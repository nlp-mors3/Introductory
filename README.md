## 📖 About the Project

The Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR) is home to rich ethnolinguistic groups, yet languages like **Ibaloi** remain underrepresented in modern technological applications. While traditional dictionaries exist, they often lack the structure required for computational processing.

**The Ibaloi NLP Lexicon System** bridges this gap. It is an academic initiative designed to create a structured, machine-readable lexicon dataset compatible with NLP processes. The system aims to support future applications such as machine translation, chatbots, and digital cultural preservation.

### Key Objectives
* **Construct a Digital Lexicon:** A structured database of Ibaloi vocabulary with English translations, POS tagging, and phonetic respelling.
* **Crowdsource Language Data:** Utilize a "Sentence Builder" to gather authentic sentence examples from the community.
* **Demonstrate NLP Capabilities:** Implement a **RASA-based** translation tool that combines lexicon matching with generative AI context injection.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Digital Lexicon
A searchable database containing over **1,500+ entries**. It serves as the core linguistic resource for the project.
* **Structured Data:** Includes variants, simplified pronunciation (adapted from Google/Oxford conventions), part of speech (POS), and synonyms.
* **Search Interface:** Allows users to filter by Ibaloi word, English translation, or spelling variants.

### 2. Sentence Builder (Crowdsourcing Tool)
To address the scarcity of digital Ibaloi resources, we developed a custom data collection module.
* **Workflow:** Users select a "Main Word" provided by our API and construct an Ibaloi sentence around it, providing an English translation.
* **Backend:** Data is processed via a Node.js API and stored in a structured sheet for validation.

### 3. RASA Translator (Hybrid Neural Translation)
A demonstration of low-resource language modeling using a hybrid approach.
* **Lexicon Matching:** Identifies and highlights known terms from the database.
* **Context Injection:** Uses a Generative AI / RASA pipeline to infer context and generate sentence predictions even when exact matches are missing.
* **Bidirectional:** Supports both English-to-Ibaloi and Ibaloi-to-English translation.

### 4. Research Paper Viewer
An integrated document viewer that presents our full study, *"Constructing a Structured Ibaloi Lexicon through Digital Resource Collection,"* making the methodology accessible to all users.

## 🔮 Message to Future Researchers & Contributors

To the students, developers, and linguists who may inherit or fork this repository:

**This project is a starting point, not a finish line.**
We created this system because we recognized that Ibaloi was falling behind in the digital age due to a lack of machine-readable datasets. We have laid the groundwork by scraping dictionaries, standardizing orthography, and building the initial collection infrastructure.

**Where you can take this next:**
1.  **Expand the Dataset:** The *Sentence Builder* is fully functional. Use it to launch wider community campaigns to gather more complex sentence structures. The more data you collect, the better the model becomes.
2.  **Refine the Model:** Our RASA implementation uses a hybrid approach. Future work could focus on fine-tuning specific Large Language Models (LLMs) specifically on the Ibaloi dataset we've started.
3.  **Audio Integration:** We structured the lexicon with pronunciation guides. A logical next step is integrating Text-to-Speech (TTS) or Speech-to-Text (STT) to support oral preservation.

Please treat the data with respect to the culture it represents. Ensure that any major changes to orthography align with the *DepEd Ibaloi Orthography* standards we followed.
